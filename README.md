I like to help people make money while lowering friction towards sustainable technological solutions for problems affecting humanity anywhere. I need at least a few more characters to make 200. Apparently that was not enough. There you go, beyond the call of duty.

##Experience

**Retired Venture Altruist**, The Good Life, *2015 â€“ Current*

cryptography, purely-functional

Finding innovative ways of expanding humanity&#39;s capacity for thought and mutual understanding. Big fan of Buckminster Fuller, Elon Musk, Vinay Gupta et al. Sorry StackOverflow doesn&#39;t let me link multiple Github accounts, but there&#39;s stuff under these usernames and organizations:

* github.com/obvio171
* github.com/vocefiscal
* github.com/ttobbec
* github.com/hsribei
* i have a whatsapp radio in brazilian portuguese sharing audio messages about news from the futures and current news looked from the futures.

My phone number is encoded here: github.com/ttobbec/rubble. I respond on WhatsApp. Thanks!

##Education

**Computer Engineering**, University of Campinas, *2004 â€“ 2009*

functional-programming, compiler-construction, cryptography, distributed-computing

I&#39;ll just copy paste from below:

I was invited to Start-Up Chile, helped Diego F. Aranha start Voc&#234; Fiscal in Brazil which (with majority effort and funding by voters themselves, no outside $) led to signed QR digests of polling tapes in all future Brazilian elections using electronic voting machines (still DRE, so long way to go). Now I&#39;m kicking back and enjoying the good life of myofascial recovery. I do most of my work for free and try to provide easy ways for the economy and society to support me. On a &quot;one of these days&quot; basis I keep coming back to the theme of atmospheric water capture and would someday like to do something for a #PlanetWithoutThirst. Go microfluidics!

**Entrepreneur**, University of Campinas, *2010 â€“ 2012*

ruby-on-rails, android, ios, mongodb, meteor, jekyll, javascript

I have never achieved any revenue as an entrepreneur whatsoever. Many times.

I still need to expand my achievements, so let&#39;s try a couple few more characters. Thank you.
